Created in 2015, TOTVS Carol it's a plataform of data and AI developed by TOTVS. The plataform it's an advanced solution of data management that can connect with different fonts of data to analyze informations and show result that support decision makes.

This way, TOTVS Carol enable informations rastreability strategies, development and deployement of machine leaning algorithms, helping with predictions and also with projects of computation vision and natural language process (NLP).

With that, TOTVS Carol enables:

* **Forecast and prevision** :chart_with_upwards_trend:: You can analyze your past data to predict the future.
* **Recomendations** :white_check_mark:: With machine learning algorithms the plataform can understand action patterns made by humans and create recomendations of how to act in similar processes.
* **Otimization** :simple-googleoptimize:: More performance and padronization with Deep Neural Network.
* **Computational vision** :eye:: You can work with real time data generated with your cameras using facial recognization.
* **Conversation experience** :material-chat:: Using NLP it's possible to create entire structure of conversations.
